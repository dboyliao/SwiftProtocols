# Swifty Protocols by Examples

In this repo, I'll try to implement all protocols provided by Swift (listed on [here](https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift)).

Every implementation is very simple. Just want to give it a try on programming with protocols.

My plan is to implement at least 5 protocols a week. So...wish me good luck(?)
